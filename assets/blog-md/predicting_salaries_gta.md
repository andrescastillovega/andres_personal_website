# Predicting salaries in the Greater Toronto Area: A Bayesian Approach
##### 15 min read

In this post, I present the main results of my master thesis in which I explore the application of bayesian inference for predicting salaries in the Greater Toronto Area (GTA). This work is designed as a component of the <a href="https://uttri.utoronto.ca/files/2018/07/ILUTE-Integrated-Land-Use-Transportation-and-Environment-Model-Reboot.pdf" target="_blank">ILUTE Framework</a> (Integrated Land-Use, Transportation, and Environment), an Agentâ€‘Based simulation model for evaluating land use and transport interactions in urban areas.

## tl;dr    
Labour markets and transportation systems are at the core of urban life. Attributes such as
residential and work locations, household income, and auto ownership are closely related to
the interactions in the labour market. Since salaries are a key component of these interac-
tions, predicting salaries becomes an important task for integrating labour market outcomes
into travel behaviour modelling. Using a data-driven approach, we estimate a Bayesian hi-
erarchical model to predict salary distributions in the Greater Toronto Area. The results of
this work demonstrate that this approach provides better estimates at both the aggregated
and disaggregated levels and generates more robust predictions by producing probability dis-
tributions instead of point estimates. This characteristic is key for using this model in an
urban simulation setting such as the ILUTE framework.
